# OpenSky Puller

This is a simple Java Project to pull Aircrafts State from the [OpenSky public API](https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/rest.html).
Then this project sends State variables to kafka topics.

The zone to scan for Aircrafts and the Kafka broker address can be configured via environment variables in *.envrc*.
